= Baby Pool -- Simple thread pool for Ruby. Released under the "MIT" license

Baby Pool is a simple, but solid implementation of a thread pool using Ruby green threads.
Pools are initialized with a thread count and an execution limit.  Baby Pool creates an array or workers
each in their own thread that listen for incoming jobs.

The pool will continue to accept work until it is drained by calling the drain method.

A quick example:

* Initialize the pool with a thread count and an execution limit.  Each thread's worker will timeout it's current job when
  it reaches the pool's execution limit.

	pool = BabyPool.new(:thread_count => 2, :execution_limit => 20)
	
* Give the pool 20 jobs to do.

	(0..20).each do |job|
	  pool.work(job) do
	    puts "Thread #{i} handling job #{job}."
	  end
	end

* When you are done, shut down the pool by calling the drain method

	pool.drain
